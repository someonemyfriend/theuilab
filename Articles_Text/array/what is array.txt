ARRAYS 

Sometimes in your applications you might be dealing with
a list of objects
For example the list of products in a shopping cart
or the list of colors the user has selescted
or to do list and so on

in situations like that you use array :)

Let's imagine you are creating a list of things

--------------------------
img of list of things here
--------------------------

Now this list is a real-world example of an array.
Let's call the piece of paper "listOfItems".
The piece of paper called "listOfItems" would be our array.
The items that will be listed on the paper are array values or array elements.


Let's see how we can create an empty array:

let listOfItems = [];

So on the left we have our variable name "listOfItems",
and we have pair of brackets on the right that shows us this variable as an empty
array.

This => [] brackets which we creating an array is better known as the array literal notation.

Now, we can create a non-empty array, we can place the items we want inside the brackets
and separate them by commas:

let listOfItems = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
